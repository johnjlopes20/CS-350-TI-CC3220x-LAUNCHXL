# CS-350-TI-CC3220x-LAUNCHXL



**Project Summary and Problem Solving**

The project involved implementing GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) interrupts on a Texas Instruments microcontroller. The primary objective was to create a simple system where pressing a button toggles the state of an LED. This setup demonstrates the fundamental use of GPIO interrupts, which is crucial for handling real-time hardware events efficiently.

**What I Did Particularly Well**

I effectively utilized the GPIO driver to configure input and output pins and set up interrupt handling. The code cleanly separates the configuration of GPIO pins from the interrupt handling logic, which is good practice. I also ensured that interrupts were enabled and properly managed, allowing for responsive interaction with hardware components.

**Where I Could Improve**

One area for improvement is the addition of error handling. Currently, the code assumes that all configurations and callbacks will work as expected without any issues. Implementing error checking and handling for GPIO operations could make the system more robust. Additionally, comments could be more detailed to explain the purpose and functionality of each section more clearly, which would aid in maintenance and readability.

**Tools and Resources Added**

I utilized the Texas Instruments GPIO driver library and configuration files for this project. These resources were essential for managing GPIO functionality and integrating with the hardware. Going forward, these tools will be beneficial for similar hardware interfacing tasks and for understanding the nuances of low-level hardware programming.

**Transferable Skills**

The skills gained from this project, such as configuring GPIOs, handling interrupts, and working with hardware drivers, are highly transferable. These skills will be useful in other projects involving embedded systems or real-time hardware interactions. Understanding how to manage hardware events efficiently is a crucial skill in many areas of embedded and systems programming.

**Maintaining, Readability, and Adaptability**

To make the project maintainable and adaptable, I followed good coding practices, such as separating configuration from callback logic and using clear naming conventions for functions and variables. The use of standard GPIO driver functions also ensures that the code can be adapted to different hardware configurations with minimal changes. However, further improvements could include modularizing the code and providing more extensive documentation for future developers or for my own reference.
